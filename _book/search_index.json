You’re trying to make the problem concrete before you translate it into the abstract. — in A Conversation with Leo Breiman [1] The inspiration for this manual comes from lecture notes in applied statistics from a course taught at the UC, Berkeley statistics department in 1991, and from the author of these notes, Professor Leo Breiman. In 2001, in an article titled Statistical Modeling: The Two Cultures [2], Leo Breiman called out the statistical community for being ill-equipped to tackle the data analytical challenges of the day. Some 14 years later the field of statistics appeared to finally be shaken out of its lull as many were asking where the field of statistics was going, or not going rather. In 50 Years of Data Science [3], Breiman’s urging academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics is recognized along with similar callings coming from contemporaries John Chambers [4], Jeff Wu (slides here), and Bill Cleveland [5] as well as from their predecessor, John Tukey [6]1 , some 50 years before them. For the period running from 2001 to 2014, Semantic Scholar recorded 639 citations to the Two Cultures paper. Since 2014, Semantic Scholar recorded 2603 citations. References in the web are countless. Almost all of the discussion of the paper has to do with the main point of the paper - the predictive versus the data modeling approach to data analysis. In addition to calling out the divide between the two cultures in terms of suitability for tackling modern day problems, in his 2001 manifesto Leo Breiman also points out that even when the data modeling approach is appropriate, statisticians are ill-prepared to solve these problems because of the training by technique taught in schools and consequent misuses of these in practice leading practitioners to view the role of the statistician as one of finding the most appropriate pre-defined technique to solve a problem, rather than trying to solve the problem directly2. The significance of this criticism of common statistical practice has been ignored by most3. While teaching the class the theoretical foundations of applied statistics, Professor Breiman often reminded us to focus on the problem; not the technique, and to clearly identify the sources of variability rather than accept that the variability assumed by any standard model is adequate. He was urging the students to think; not follow recipes. This is central dogma of this monograph: think before you stat. Leo Breiman’s career followed a very interesting and unusual path. He left an academic post as a theoretical probabilist to earn a living as a consultant while teaching mathematics to kids from Mexico. In doing so he became deeply interested in the education system. He ran for and was elected to the Santa Monica School Board and soon after became its president. While he was “having a wonderful time consulting… solving real problems, working with data,” he was offered a faculty position in the Department of Statistics at UC, Berkeley, which he accepted [1,8]4. 2.1 Nail Finders, The Edifice Complex and Oz A short time after returning to academics, Professor Breiman wrote an interesting paper titled “Nail Finders, Edifices, and Oz” [7]. He writes: The thesis of this paper is that many, if not most, statisticians in government and industry are poorly trained for their profession with the result that they are poor problem solvers … While we may disagree as to whether or not statisticians deserve this characterization, we have to agree that the traits described in the paper are best avoided - the find-the-nail, edifice and Oz complex. The find-the-nail complex If all you have is a hammer, then every problem will look like a nail. — Jerome Freidman saying (source unknown) [7] Applied to statisticians, this refers to absorption with the technique (unhealthy infatuation with models?) rather than with the problem; “the failure to see the problem whole; to ask, Does it all make sense?” and, dare I say, “where’s the randomness coming from.” Are statisticians nail-finders? How many of us have encountered survival data at work and Not used the Cox proportional hazards model to analyze the data? How many of us have used something other than logistic or probit regression to analyze data when the outcome is dichotomous. In some cases these techniques are appropriate, but there must be numerous cases when some other approach would be preferable, but never considered. The nail finder syndrome is encouraged to a large extent by the usual textbook format which includes neat examples associated with each introduced technique. This format leads to the belief that there is a ready-made canned solution for every problem. In this modus operandi, little to no effort is spent trying to get to a deep understanding of the problem at hand, and the data to help solve the problem; one only tries to characterize the problem to the extent necessary to find a suitably well matched canned solution. In laying out these notes we will avoid this format. Case studies in data analysis will be laid out in separate sections with no connection to the notes sections, some of which do introduce specific analysis methods. The edifice complex This refers to the building of a large, elaborate and many layered statistical analysis often covering up what is simple and obvious.* Another trap best avoided - inventing complexity when there isn’t any. Not every problem presented to a statistician requires statistical methodologies for their solution. In some cases the solution may reveal itself in a plot or in a sketch which captures the essence of the problem. The Wizard of Oz Complex The exploitation of the mysteries of statistics to dazzle and mystify the less knowledgable. This calls for a little break: Include illustrations of the above - open contributions from XXXers 2.2 Where’s the randomness? In God we trust. All others, bring data and Leave your beliefs at the door5. — adapted from W. Edwards Deming Against this background for the need of change, when we enter Leo Breiman’s classroom we enter a world deeply steeped in the theoretical underpinnings of applied statistics. Although all of the necessary theory was included in the course material, we spent very little time marvelling at the beauty of the mathematical results underlying some statistical theories (for example …) and instead were encouraged and challenged to struggle with difficult questions: what happens if this assumption is not true? or that assumption? I remember one particular lecture watching Professor Breiman repeating the mantra “where is the randomness? where’s the randomness coming from?” while pacing up and down the front of the class. Some 30 years later, faced with the problem of trying to answer questions about a system generating data which comes in the form of batches of points having a yet to be fully understood correlation structure, and subject to sporadic surges of variation of unknown origin, Professor Breiman’s words reverberate in my head. I now fully appreciate the relevance of the question - where’s the randomness coming from. I don’t think there is any exaggeration in claiming that if we can identify the relevant sources of variability, and how to capture them in an analysis dataset, we have basically fully solved the data analytic problem: we know exactly what data to collect and how to summarize them in order to answer the question of interest. 2.3 What next? If the doors of perception were cleansed every thing would appear to man as it is, Infinite — William Blake, The Marriage of Heaven and Hell (1790) The theory The plan is to go through professor Breiman’s notes and to connect the principles and questions raised to problems we face, thinking about the data and sources of variability - where is the randomness coming from. Having gone through these notes, we should be convinced of the truth of this idiom, and this in turn will provide the motivation and drive necessary to get to a full and accurate knowledge of the randomness present in the task at hand: there should never be any guessing or nonchalant presuming involved - the case for any assumed randomness in a data model must be made explicitly6. With this practice we can gain an appropriate level of confidence in the results that we gather to be true, and we should only have to deal with risks coming from well understood variability. Unexpected surprises will become the exception rather than the rule. This is the dream, and it remains a dream while we follow recipes and deliver ready-made solutions rather than tackle problems with an appropriate measure of ingenuity and perseverance. Professor Breiman’s class notes provide the statistical theory necessary to move forward with most data analysis projects. This may be a minimalists’ point of view in terms of required statistical theory background; we will see as we work through some problems. The practice Leo Breiman firmly believed that statistics is about solving problems. We would not be doing justice to his legacy if we just went through his notes which describe some helpful theory whose only relevance in Professor Breiman’s mind was to provide tools to solve problems. With that in mind the essential content of this manuscript will not be the notes on theory, but illustration of applied statistics at work in solving problems. The task is therefore to include numerous case studies illustrating good data analysis practice. To be determined is the lay-out - where to insert the case studies. One thing is certain: we have to avoid the usual format of attaching examples to techniques as they are introduced. The usual textbook format which ties trivial, neat examples to technique as each new technique is introduced leads the reader to make unduly strong association between problem and technique, and to the belief that matching problems to textbook technique is the crunch of statistical analysis7. — Stat Student References "]]
